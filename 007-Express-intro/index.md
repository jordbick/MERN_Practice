#Express

Express is very similar to Spring
Javascript API framework

Minimalist framework to handle web functionality in node.js applications

Limited functionality, it is customisable through middleware

Middleware - Helps communication between two layers
Client <-> Server

Express gives us a HTTP Request API we can customise - GET, POST, PUT/PATCh, DELETE


#  Request Handling
Specifying what you want the app to do
Express method:
express().get
express().delete
etc..
